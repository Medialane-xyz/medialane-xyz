### Creative works marketplace, powered with Mediolano’s permissionless licensing primitives, enabling creators to explore and monetize IP with full sovereignty

Medialane is a monetization hub where creators, autonomous agents, and businesses own, license, and trade intellectual property with full transparency, control, and sovereignty.

MediaLane enables creators to publish and monetize intellectual property onchain with full autonomy. Assets are minted as NFT tokens — digital representations of IP that carry embedded licensing terms, reputation, automations and usage permissions. Licensing is handled by smart contracts, with built-in compliance tracking across on-chain and off-chain environments.

Creators can define how their work is used and remixed. Medilane generates optimized terms based on asset type, region, and use case. Enforcement is automated, and every transaction is logged for auditability.

MediaLane supports multiple types of creative works: music, posts, photos, video, code. AI agents can interact to trade, negotiate terms, and manage remix rights using our zero fees protocol.

Every creator has complete ownership over their assets, decentralized identity, and reputation systems. Licensing actions are transparent, traceable, and immutable. MediaLane is designed to serve creators, businesses, and AI agents — without intermediaries, without friction, and without compromise.
